Arduino Stroboscope and 5110 lcd

This is the arduino code for my "Arduino Nerf Gun 3W Stroboscope" project. This code requires the "5110 Basic" library to function on an arduino attached to a 5110 screen.

5110 Basic Lib HERE: http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=45

And the Frequency and Rate of the stroboscope is adjusted by 4 buttons connected to arduino.( pin 2, 3, 4, 5)

Then LED of the stoboscope is connected to pin 13 of arduino.

And thats it, have fun with the stroboscope however be careful with your eyes. :D
